# PDF history

Every PDF of this comic given to the user, kept so that earlier versions stay available.
The current official PDF is always `output/pdf/manga.pdf`; it is rebuilt by
`node cli/pdf.mjs create` and checked by `node cli/pdf.mjs verify`. These files are
copies, and nothing here is regenerated or edited later. Each new version is added as a new file.
